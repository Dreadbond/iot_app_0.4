  "readme": "# react-sound\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-sound.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sound)\n\nSound component to play audio in your web apps. Backed by the mighty [soundmanager2](https://github.com/scottschiller/SoundManager2) library.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\n// In your React component:\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <Sound\n      url=\"cool_sound.mp3\"\n      playStatus={Sound.status.PLAYING}\n      playFromPosition={300 /* in milliseconds */}\n      onLoading={this.handleSongLoading}\n      onPlaying={this.handleSongPlaying}\n      onFinishedPlaying={this.handleSongFinishedPlaying}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Sound as a component?\n\nYes! It's really easy to use sounds in your app as part of the component tree in your React app.\n\n* **Want to start playing a sound?** Just render it with a `PLAYING` status.\n* **Want to remove a playing sound?** Just stop rendering it.\n* **Want to sync it with your app state?** Render it using props and state, just as with any React component!\n\n## How to install\n\n`npm install react-sound --save`\n\n## How to use\n\n```js\nvar React = require('react');\nvar Sound = require('react-sound').default;\n\n// ... or using import:\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Sound from 'react-sound';\n\nclass MyComponentWithSound extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <Sound {...props} />; // Check props in next section\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** By default, a restriction on mobile prevent you from playing multiple sounds. To avoid this, you need to set the `ignoreMobileRestrictions` property to `true` when setting up [soundManager2](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/doc/).\n\n### Props\n\n* *url (string)*: The url of the sound to play.\n* *playStatus (Sound.status.{PLAYING,STOPPED,PAUSED})*: The current sound playing status. Change it in successive renders to play, stop, pause and resume the sound.\n* *playFromPosition (number)*: Seeks to the position specified by this prop, any time it changes. After that, the sound will continue playing (or not, if the `playStatus` is not `PLAYING`). Use this prop to seek to different positions in the sound, but not use it as a controlled component. You should use either this prop or `position`, but not both.\n* *position (number)*: The current position the sound is at. Use this to make the component a controlled component, meaning that you must update this prop on every `onPlaying` callback. You should use either this prop or `playFromPosition`, but not both.\n* *volume (number)*: The current sound's volume. A value between 0 and 100.\n* *autoLoad (boolean)*: If the sound should start loading automatically (defaults to `false`).\n* *onLoading (function)*: Function that gets called while the sound is loading. It receives an object with properties `bytesLoaded`, `bytesTotal` and `duration`.\n* *onPlaying (function)*: Function that gets called while the sound is playing. It receives an object with properties `position` and `duration`.\n* *onPause (function)*: Function that gets called when the sound is paused. It receives an object with properties `position` and `duration`.\n* *onResume (function)*: Function that gets called while the sound is resumed playing. It receives an object with properties `position` and `duration`.\n* *onStop (function)*: Function that gets called while the sound playback is stopped. It receives an object with properties `position` and `duration`.\n* *onFinishedPlaying (function)*: Function that gets called when the sound finishes playing (reached end of sound). It receives no parameters.\n\n## How to contribute\n\nFeel free to fork and send PRs or issues, be it for features, bug fixes, or documentation!\n",
